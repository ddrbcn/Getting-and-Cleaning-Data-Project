Getting and Cleaning Data Project

I only use one script. In the first block I read the names of the features. 
In the second block I read and merge the data from the X_train.txt and X_test.txt files. After that I merge the training and test datasets.

In the third block I extract the required information  only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation. After that I extract subject information and labels. 

The for loop appropriately labeled the data set and finally I merge the data in order to obtain the require result.
